## Project Description

This application provides a basic shop inventory and booking system for a fictional ocean safari company, leveraging new skills with MongoDB, Express, and Node.

### Phase One: Ocean Apparel

The first phase of the project is creating a functional inventory tracker where the Owner can manage their products.

Products offered include:

- Stickers
- Rash guards
- Sun hoodies
- Hats

### Phase Two: Safaris

**Users** can see the available tour options, read descriptions of each option, and browse images from each type of trip offered. They can then book a trip if enough spots are available.

**Managers** can perform all the actions of a user in addition to creating new tours and editing all information on the site.

Happy diving!
